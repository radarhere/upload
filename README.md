# upload

Automatic upload application

## What is it?

At my church, once the user had recorded the week's sermon audio, there were still many steps to get them to upload it onto the church site. They had to convert it to a lower quality recording in iTunes, then find the file, then login to the site, then select and upload the file, and after all that, they didn't have a progress bar to be able to track the state of the upload. Having no control over the site, I instead decided to create an application that could automatically run through this process completely, selecting the most recent item from iTunes, use AppleScript to begin the conversion process, and use Python to upload the file and track the file upload using a file access wrapper.

## Why is it called Upload?

I had the icon from an earlier version of a different project?
